This repository contains the basic version of the project titled as "Data Driven Learning of Constrained Measurement Matrices for Signal Reconstruction". The python file Model_recon.py implements the bluerprint of the DNN architecture for creating measurements and reconstruction. TCI_Con_Base.py runs the training and testing phase of the proposed data driven learning architecture for image reconstruction. We have used the DNN architecture of the paper titled as  "Joint Learning of Measurement Matrix and Signal Reconstruction via Deep Learning". https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9050520
